## Features
- User authentication and authorization. With different roles and permissions (the same Roles can have different permissions)
- CRUD operations for managing data
- Table view of data
- Custom validation logic

## Technologies Used
- List the technologies and tools used in your project. For example:
    - Backend:
        - Spring Boot
        - Spring Security (JWT)
        - Hibernate
        - PostgreSQL
        - Flyway migration
    - Frontend:
        - React
        - DevExpress

## Project Roadmap and Issues

### Current Issues
📌 Еhe frontend of the application lacks proper exception handling, which leads to poor user experience when unexpected errors occur.

### Refactoring and Optimization

📌 Rewrite State Manager to Redux - Currently, the state management in the frontend is done using `useContext`, which can lead to performance issues and complex code. We should refactor the state management to use Redux for better organization and scalability.

📌 Frontend Code Refactoring - Refactor frontend code to improve maintainability and reduce spaghetti  code O-o.

## Getting Started
To get started with the Full-Stack Spring Boot and React Application, follow the steps below:
### Installation
Before running the application, make sure you have the following installed on your system:
1. **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Ensure you have Java 11 or later installed
2. **Node.js**: Install Node.js, which includes npm (Node Package Manager)
3. **PostgreSQL Database**: Install PostgreSQL on your system, and set up a database for the application
4. Clone the repository to your local machine using Git:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/fullstack-spring-react.git
cd fullstack-spring-react
```

### Configuration
2.Create an `application-local.properties` file in the `resources` folder and write the following parameters in it

```properties
spring.datasource.username=your_username
spring.datasource.password=your_password
```

3. Install frontend dependencies and build the React application:
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run build
cd ..
```

### Running the Application

Now you're all set to run the full-stack application:

1. Start the Spring Boot backend server (if you haven't already):

`./mvnw spring-boot:run`

The backend server will be running at `http://localhost:8090.

2. Start the React frontend server:
   `cd frontend npm start`

The frontend server will be running at `http://localhost:3000`.
